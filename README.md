Technological advancement continues to significantly impact all spheres of life, especially in the medical and healthcare domains. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated remarkable potential in healthcare by enabling data-driven decision-making and accelerating diagnostics. One of the most crucial steps in controlling the spread of life-threatening diseases is early detection, which can dramatically reduce transmission and improve outcomes.

COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory illness, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and was officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019. The virus posed a serious global threat and was named COVID-19 by WHO on February 11, 2020. It was declared a public health emergency due to its rapid spread and severe health implications. The virus spreads primarily through the respiratory tract, and infected individuals typically show symptoms within 2 to 14 days. Common symptoms include fever, dry cough, and fatigue, while severe cases may present with dyspnea and persistent chest pain. People with comorbidities such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are particularly vulnerable to severe illness.

As of 2025, although vaccination campaigns and public health strategies have reduced COVID-19 fatality rates, new variants continue to emerge periodically, necessitating the development of rapid, intelligent detection systems. The abundance of COVID-19-related health data today, combined with the growing use of AI in healthcare, provides a unique opportunity to build predictive models for early diagnosis and risk assessment.

This project aims to compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, for the task of predicting COVID-19 infection based on patient symptoms and exposure history. After evaluating their accuracies, the most effective algorithm was selected for the final predictive model. The goal of this system is to assist in quick and accessible pre-diagnosis, especially in regions with limited access to laboratory testing, ultimately contributing to faster isolation and treatment.
